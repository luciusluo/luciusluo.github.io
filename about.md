This is Yuxiao (Lucius) Luo, and welcome to my site! I'm currently a 4<sup>th</sup>-year Computer Engineering undergrad at [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu). I'm using this blog to document my learning notes and share my learning paths with others. I may also post some interesting ideas or papers here in hope of sparkling up the creativity of whoever visits my website :)

I'm interested in the intersection of CV and NLP, and other broad topics about ML. I believe that the best way to learn new knowledge is to understand their fundamental structure and compare them with the old ones.
