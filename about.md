This is Lucius Luo, and welcome to my site! I'm currently a 4<sup>th</sup>-year Computer Engineering undergrad at [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu). I'm using this blog to document my learning notes and share my learning paths with others. 

I'm interested in the intersection of CV and NLP, and broadly AutoML. I believe that the best way to learn new knowledge is to understand their fundamental structures, and compare them with those of the old ones. 

My fav words: addition, comparison, assumption, generalization.
